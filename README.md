This fun mini-project was created to display my ability to implement the Spotify API to a React website and to practice my CSS skills.

Once entering a song in the search bar, Spotify will open up and request your login information. If you do not have a login with Spotify, you can sign-up for free. Once logged in, you can search any artist, album or song name and the results from spotify will be displayed in the box called Results in descending order. You can choose to make a personalized playlist for your Spotify account by clicking the '+' sign next to the track you would like to add. The track will then be added to the New Playlist column, in which you can change the name 'New Playlist' to personalize it. You will notice you can remove songs from your playlist by clicking the '-', in case you change your mind or have added the wrong song by accident. Now that you've created your playlist you can save it by clicking on the 'Save to Spotify' button, it will be automatically updated to your personal Spotify account.

I am currently working on having a section with your saved, now past playlist with the possibility of other Spotify playlists from your personal account already displayed.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
